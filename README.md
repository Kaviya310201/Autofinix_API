# Autofinix_API
This FastAPI app provides a REST API to manage customer data for an AutoLoan system, with endpoints to create, read, update, and delete customer records. It uses PostgreSQL for data storage, interacting through SQL queries via psycopg2. The API includes validation with Pydantic models and error handling using HTTPException.
